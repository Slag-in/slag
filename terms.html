      <h2>Return Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We take pride in curating and delivering quality thrifted and vintage clothing.
        Each piece is carefully inspected before shipping to ensure it meets our quality standards.
        However, since our products are pre-loved, minor signs of wear may be present.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you receive an item with a major defect or damage that was not mentioned in the product description,
        you may request a return or exchange.
      </p>

      <h3>Eligibility for Return</h3>
      <p>To qualify for a return:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You must record a clear unboxing video from the moment you open the package — this serves as proof that the
          defect was present at the time of delivery.</li>
        <li>The video should clearly show the package, product, and defect without any cuts or edits.</li>
        <li>The return request must be submitted within 24 hours of delivery.</li>
        <li>The item must be unused, unwashed, and in its original condition with all tags intact.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Non-Returnable Items</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Items without a valid unboxing video.</li>
        <li>Items that show signs of wear, washing, or alteration after delivery.</li>
        <li>Items listed as “Final Sale” or “Exclusive Drop”.</li>
        <li>Color variation or minor vintage imperfections that are typical of thrifted clothing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Return Process</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Record a full unboxing video as mentioned above.</li>
        <li>Contact our support team (via email or Instagram handle).</li>
        <li>Provide your order ID, unboxing video, and a brief description of the issue.</li>
        <li>Our team will review your claim and respond within 2–3 business days.</li>
        <li>If approved, you’ll receive return instructions or a replacement option.</li>
        <li>Any other reasons. (The size, texture and every other details related to the cloth should be carefully
          reviewed in the website before ordering.)</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds (if applicable) will be issued to your original payment method after the returned item passes quality
        inspection. Processing times may vary depending on your bank or payment provider.
      </p>

      <h2>Order Cancellation Policy</h2>
      <p>
        All sales made through our thrift store are final. Once an order has been placed and confirmed, it cannot be
        canceled, modified, or refunded under any circumstances. This policy is in place because each item is unique and
        may be immediately processed, packaged, or reserved upon purchase, making cancellations or changes impractical.
        We encourage customers to carefully review product descriptions, sizes, and images before completing their
        purchase. By placing an order on our website, you acknowledge and agree to this no-cancellation policy. In the
        event of exceptional situations such as duplicate payments or system errors, you may contact our support team
        for assistance, and such cases will be reviewed at our sole discretion.
      </p>

      <h2>Product Hygiene and Care</h2>
      <p>
        At our thrift store, we prioritize cleanliness and customer satisfaction. Every clothing item is carefully
        inspected, cleaned, and washed before packing to ensure it reaches you in fresh and wearable condition. We take
        great care in maintaining hygiene standards during handling and packaging, using safe and fabric-appropriate
        cleaning methods. While some vintage or delicate pieces may show minor signs of pre-loved wear due to their
        unique nature, we make sure that all items are thoroughly sanitized and ready for immediate use upon arrival.
      </p>

      <h2>Thrift Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Our thrifted garments are pre-owned, pre-loved, and curated for their unique character and style.
        These pieces may show slight signs of age or wear, which are natural to their vintage nature.
      </p>

      <p>Please note that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All thrifted items are sourced and resold by Slag.</li>
        <li>We do not claim brand ownership or design credits for any thrifted garments.</li>
        <li>All original copyrights and trademarks belong to their respective brands.</li>
        <li>The thrift policy applies only to thrifted pieces listed on our website or store.</li>
      </ul>
